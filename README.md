# McBot

## What the heck is this?
McBot is a super basic Discord bot for interacting with RCON on a Minecraft server. Really it was just created for my own purposes, but it's cool if somebody else can make use of it.

McBot is meant to run in a Docker container if only because I wanted to learn how to work with Docker containers.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
